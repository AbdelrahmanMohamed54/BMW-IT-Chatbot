# BMW Chatbot Frontend

## Overview

The frontend of the BMW Chatbot provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the chatbot, enabling real-time communication and delivering a seamless experience for users seeking information on BMW cars, including recommendations, availability, and details. Built with React and styled with custom CSS, the frontend also utilizes Bootstrap for responsive design and jQuery for additional interactivity.

## Project Structure

The frontend directory is organized into three main folders: `build`, `public`, and `src`, each serving a specific purpose in the development and deployment of the application.

### Build Folder

Contains the production build of the frontend application, including minified versions of CSS and JavaScript files for performance optimization. It's generated by running the `npm run build` command and includes:

- `bootstrap.min.css` & `bootstrap.min.js`: Minified Bootstrap files for styling and interactive components.
- `index.html`: The entry point for the application when deployed.
- `jquery.min.js`: Minified jQuery library for DOM manipulation and AJAX requests.
- `styles.css`: Custom styles that apply globally across the application.

### Public Folder

Houses static assets and the main HTML file for the application in development mode. It mirrors the structure of the `build` folder but is used during development for quick iterations:

- `bootstrap.min.css` & `bootstrap.min.js`: Bootstrap files included for styling and JavaScript components.
- `index.html`: Serves as the template for the React application.
- `jquery.min.js`: jQuery library for additional scripting.
- `styles.css`: Custom global styles for the application.

### Src Folder

Contains the React components and CSS files that make up the application. Each component is styled with a corresponding CSS file for modular and maintainable code structure:

- `App.css` & `App.js`: The main application component that orchestrates the layout and integrates other components.
- `ChatHeader.css` & `ChatHeader.js`: Manages the presentation of the chat header, including the BMW logo and chatbot name.
- `ChatMessage.css` & `ChatMessage.js`: Handles the display of chat messages between the user and the chatbot.
- `InputField.css` & `InputField.js`: Provides the input field component for users to type their messages.
- `Message.css` & `Message.js`: Defines the structure and styling for individual messages within the chat.
- `index.js`: The entry point for the React application, where the root component is rendered.

## Installation

To set up the frontend for development:

1. Ensure Node.js and npm are installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
3. Install the dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server with:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

This will serve the application on `http://localhost:3000` and automatically open it in your default web browser.

## Usage

The frontend application allows users to interact with the BMW Chatbot through a chat interface. Users can send messages regarding their preferences or inquiries about BMW cars, and the chatbot will respond in real time with recommendations, availability, and detailed information.
